# ReverseSplice

Small piece of software written for supervisors to be used in conjunction with the MersSplicer. Given a 
list of peptides and a list of proteins, this software outputs a series of csv files detailing the peptides
from which each peptide may have been form.

This uses similar algorithms to MersSplicer, and was deemed not to require a user manual as it was only required 
for a handful of specific tests.
